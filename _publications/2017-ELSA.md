This is a work in collaboration with researchers of the Center for Clinical and Epidemiologic Research of the University Hospital of Sao Paulo. We used partial least square path analysis to investigate the association between short-term systolic blood pressure variability and carotid intima-media thickness, a non-invasive marker for early subclinical atherosclerosis, in the baseline of the large Brazilian cohort ELSA-Brasil.
