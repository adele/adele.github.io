About
======

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Causal Artificial Intelligence (CausalAI) Laboratory, mentored by Professor Elias Bareinboim. My research lies at the intersection of Computer Science, Statistics, and Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, including Causal Inference and Learning, Deep Generative and Discriminative Models, Statistical Genetics and Neuroscience, and Multi-Omics Analysis. I am currently interested in the emergent field of Causal Health Sciences, which focuses on discovering, integrating, generalizing, and personalizing causal findings by taking advantage of the vast, but imperfect and heterogeneous, amounts of observational and experimental data available.
